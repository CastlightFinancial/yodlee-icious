# Yodlicious

Yodlicisous is a ruby gem wrapping the Yodlee REST(ish) API. We had to build this for our integration with Yodlee which was somewhat more painfull than it should have been so we figured we share to be a good neighbor.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'yodlicious'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install yodlicious
